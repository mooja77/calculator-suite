## 📊 New Calculators Added

### 1. Break-Even Calculator (`/calculators/breakeven/`)

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Break-even point calculation (units and revenue)
- ✅ Contribution margin analysis  
- ✅ Safety margin assessment
- ✅ Multiple business scenarios
- ✅ Health indicators with business recommendations
- ✅ Current profit/loss analysis

**Business Logic**:
- Fixed costs + Variable costs + Target profit
- Contribution margin = Price - Variable cost per unit
- Break-even units = (Fixed costs + Target profit) / Contribution margin

**Validation**:
- Ensures variable cost < price per unit
- Warns about high break-even points
- Provides realistic business guidance

- ✅ Profit margin inclusion
- ✅ Multiple payment structures (hourly, daily, weekly, project)
- ✅ Employee salary equivalent comparison
- ✅ Rate breakdown analysis
- ✅ Industry benchmark recommendations

**Business Logic**:
- Gross income needed = (Desired salary + Expenses) / (1 - Tax rate)
- Base rate = Gross income / Total billable hours
- Recommended rate = Base rate × (1 + Profit margin)
- Accounts for self-employment tax, benefits, business expenses

**Validation**:
- Warns about excessive billable hours (>40/week)
- Suggests conservative tax rates (25-35%)
- Provides industry-appropriate rate ranges
