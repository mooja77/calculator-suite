# Auto Loan vs Lease Calculator - Frequently Asked Questions

## Basic Leasing vs Financing Questions

### What's the main difference between leasing and financing?
**Financing (buying):**
- You own the car after paying off the loan
- Build equity as you make payments
- No mileage restrictions or wear requirements
- Responsible for maintenance after warranty expires
- Can modify or sell the vehicle anytime

**Leasing:**
- You rent the car for a specific period (usually 2-4 years)
- Pay only for the depreciation during your lease term
- Must return in good condition with mileage limits
- Warranty typically covers the entire lease period
- No equity built, but lower monthly payments

### Which is cheaper: leasing or buying?
**It depends on your timeframe:**

**Short-term (1-3 years): Leasing often wins**
- Lower monthly payments
- No major maintenance costs
- Avoid steepest depreciation period

**Long-term (5+ years): Buying typically wins**
- Stop making payments after loan is paid off
- Build equity that can be used for next purchase
- No mileage restrictions or wear charges

**Example:** $30,000 car over 6 years
- **Lease**: Two 3-year leases ≈ $18,000 total cost, no asset
- **Finance**: 6 years of payments ≈ $15,000 net cost, own $15,000 asset

### Why are lease payments lower than loan payments?
**You're only paying for partial usage, not full ownership:**

**Lease payment covers:**
- Depreciation during your lease term only
- Interest on the depreciation amount
- Lease fees and taxes

**Loan payment covers:**
- Full vehicle value minus down payment
- Interest on entire loan amount
- The vehicle becomes yours at the end

**Example:** $40,000 car, 3 years
- **Lease**: Pay for $18,000 depreciation = ~$450/month
- **Finance**: Pay for $37,000 loan = ~$650/month

## Mileage and Usage Questions

### What happens if I exceed my lease mileage?
**You'll pay overage charges at lease end:**
- **Typical penalty**: $0.15 to $0.30 per excess mile
- **No early reduction**: Can't reduce allowance mid-lease for refund

**Example overage costs:**
- 12,000-mile lease, drove 15,000 miles annually
- 3,000 excess miles × $0.25 = $750 per year
- Over 3-year lease: $2,250 total penalty

**Strategies to avoid overages:**
- Accurately estimate annual mileage before signing
- Purchase higher mileage allowance upfront (cheaper than penalties)
- Consider early lease termination if consistently over

### Can I buy more miles during my lease?
**Usually yes, and it's cheaper than paying penalties:**
- **Upfront purchase**: Often $0.10-0.15 per mile
- **End-of-lease penalty**: $0.15-0.30 per mile
- **When to buy**: If you know you'll exceed allowance

**Example:**
- Need extra 3,000 miles for 3-year lease
- **Upfront cost**: 3,000 × $0.12 = $360 total
- **Penalty cost**: 3,000 × $0.25 = $750 total
- **Savings**: $390 by purchasing upfront

### What is considered normal wear and tear?
**Acceptable wear (not charged):**
- Small dings less than 2 inches
- Stone chips on paint/windshield
- Tire wear with 2/32" minimum tread
- Interior wear consistent with mileage
- Minor scuffs and scratches

**Excessive wear (you pay):**
- Dents larger than 2 inches
- Scratches through to metal
- Cracked or broken glass
- Stained, torn, or burned interior
- Tire wear beyond specifications
- Missing parts or equipment

**Typical charges:**
- Tire replacement: $600-1,200
- Paint scratch repair: $300-800 per panel
- Interior cleaning/repair: $100-500
- **Budget**: $1,000-3,000 for potential charges

## Financial and Tax Questions

### Are there tax advantages to leasing?
**Tax benefits vary by situation:**

**Personal use:**
- **Lease**: Pay sales tax only on monthly payments
- **Purchase**: Pay sales tax on full price upfront
- **Savings**: Spread tax cost over lease term

**Business use:**
- **Lease**: Often 100% deductible as business expense
- **Purchase**: Subject to depreciation limits and Section 179 rules
- **Advantage**: Leasing often provides higher deductions

**Example business deduction:**
- $500 monthly lease payment = $6,000 annual deduction
- $30,000 vehicle purchase = Limited by depreciation rules

### Can I negotiate lease terms?
**Yes, most lease terms are negotiable:**

**Negotiable items:**
- **Vehicle price (cap cost)**: Negotiate like a purchase
- **Down payment**: Can be reduced or eliminated
- **Interest rate (money factor)**: Shop different lenders
- **Fees**: Some acquisition fees can be negotiated
- **Mileage allowance**: Purchase higher limits upfront

**Non-negotiable items:**
- **Residual value**: Set by manufacturer/leasing company
- **Standard wear and tear guidelines**
- **Early termination formula**

### What about gap insurance?
**Gap insurance is crucial for both leasing and financing:**

**What it covers:**
- Difference between insurance payout and loan/lease balance
- Essential when you owe more than vehicle's worth

**Leasing:**
- **Usually required** by lease agreement
- Often included in monthly payment
- Protects against total loss scenarios

**Financing:**
- **Recommended** especially with low down payment
- Available through dealer or insurance company
- Cost: $300-700 over loan term

## Early Termination and End-of-Lease Questions

### Can I end my lease early?
**Yes, but it's usually expensive:**

**Early termination costs:**
- Remaining depreciation payments
- Early termination fees ($300-500+)
- Disposition fees
- Excess wear and mileage charges

**Better alternatives:**
- **Lease transfer**: Find someone to take over payments
- **Trade for new lease**: Dealer may absorb some costs
- **Purchase the vehicle**: Pay residual value

**When it makes sense:**
- Major life changes (job loss, relocation)
- Vehicle no longer meets needs
- Excessive anticipated wear/mileage charges

### What are my options at lease end?
**You typically have three choices:**

**1. Return the vehicle**
- Pay any excess wear/mileage charges
- Pay disposition fee ($300-500)
- Walk away with no further obligation

**2. Purchase the vehicle**
- Pay predetermined residual value
- Good option if market value exceeds residual
- Finance the purchase if needed

**3. Lease/buy a new vehicle**
- Start fresh lease with new car
- Trade in current lease (if positive equity)
- Dealer may waive disposition fee

### How do I know if I should buy my lease?
**Buy if the residual value is below market value:**

**Example analysis:**
- Lease residual value: $18,000
- Actual market value: $21,000
- **Decision**: Buy for $18,000, immediate $3,000 equity

**Check market value using:**
- Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, or AutoTrader
- Local dealer appraisals
- CarMax or similar instant offers

**Consider additional factors:**
- Your attachment to the vehicle
- Upcoming maintenance needs
- Availability of newer model incentives

## Special Situations

### What if I have bad credit?
**Leasing typically requires better credit than financing:**

**Lease requirements:**
- Usually need 650+ credit score
- Higher security deposits for lower scores
- Limited vehicle selection

**Financing options:**
- Available for wider credit range
- Subprime lenders for poor credit
- Higher interest rates but still possible

**Credit improvement strategies:**
- Pay down existing debt
- Make all payments on time
- Consider co-signer
- Wait and improve score before leasing

### Can I modify a leased vehicle?
**Generally no, without risking charges:**

**Prohibited modifications:**
- Aftermarket wheels/tires
- Paint or wrap changes
- Interior modifications
- Performance modifications
- Permanent alterations

**Potential consequences:**
- Restoration charges at lease end
- Lease violation and early termination
- Loss of warranty coverage

**Exception:** Easily removable accessories that don't alter vehicle

### What about insurance requirements?
**Leasing typically requires higher coverage:**

**Lease insurance requirements:**
- **Comprehensive and collision**: Usually required
- **Higher liability limits**: Often $100,000/$300,000+
- **Gap insurance**: Usually mandatory
- **Lower deductibles**: Often $500 maximum

**Financing insurance requirements:**
- **Comprehensive and collision**: Required until paid off
- **Liability limits**: State minimums acceptable
- **Gap insurance**: Recommended but optional
- **Flexible deductibles**: Your choice

**Cost impact:**
- Lease insurance often 10-20% higher
- Factor into total monthly cost comparison

## Making the Decision

### How do I decide between leasing and financing?
**Consider these key factors:**

**Choose leasing if you:**
- Want lower monthly payments
- Like driving newer vehicles with latest features
- Drive less than 12,000 miles annually
- Take excellent care of vehicles
- Want predictable costs with warranty coverage
- Can benefit from business tax deductions

**Choose financing if you:**
- Want to build equity and ownership
- Drive high mileage (15,000+ annually)
- Plan long-term ownership (5+ years)
- Want freedom to modify vehicle
- Prefer eventual end to monthly payments
- Don't mind higher maintenance costs

### What questions should I ask dealers?
**Important lease questions:**
- What's the exact money factor (interest rate)?
- What's the residual value percentage?
- What fees are included (acquisition, disposition)?
- What's the mileage allowance and overage rate?
- What's considered normal wear and tear?
- Can I purchase additional miles upfront?

**Important financing questions:**
- What's the APR and total interest cost?
- Are there prepayment penalties?
- What's required for insurance coverage?
- Is gap insurance available and recommended?
- What's the total cost over the loan term?

### Should I put money down on a lease?
**Generally, minimize money down on leases:**

**Reasons to avoid large down payments:**
- **Total loss risk**: Down payment not recoverable if car totaled
- **No equity building**: Money doesn't build ownership
- **Lower effective return**: Better to invest money elsewhere

**When down payments make sense:**
- **Lower monthly payment needed** for budget
- **Dealer incentives** require specific down payment
- **Reduce total cost** through manufacturer rebates

**Recommended approach:** Put down only what's needed for acceptable monthly payment.
