# Complete Guide to Auto Loan vs Lease Decision

## Understanding Financing vs Leasing

### Auto Financing Fundamentals
**When you finance a vehicle:**
- You own the car (after final payment)
- Build equity as you pay down the loan
- Can drive unlimited miles
- Responsible for all maintenance after warranty
- Can modify the vehicle as desired
- Must carry comprehensive insurance
- Vehicle value belongs to you

**Financing Process:**
1. Apply for loan pre-approval
2. Shop for vehicle within approved amount
3. Make down payment and sign loan documents
4. Make monthly payments for loan term
5. Own vehicle free and clear when paid off

### Auto Leasing Fundamentals
**When you lease a vehicle:**
- You rent the car for a specified period
- Pay for the depreciation during your use
- Return vehicle at lease end (usually)
- Have mileage restrictions (typically 10K-15K annually)
- Must maintain vehicle to lease standards
- Required to carry gap insurance
- No ownership equity built

**Leasing Process:**
1. Choose vehicle and negotiate lease terms
2. Make down payment and sign lease agreement
3. Make monthly payments for lease term
4. Return vehicle or buy at residual value
5. Start new lease or purchase if desired

## Financial Analysis Deep Dive

### Monthly Payment Comparison

**Why lease payments are lower:**
- You only pay for depreciation, not full vehicle value
- Depreciation over 2-4 years vs 5-7 year loans
- Lower interest rates (money factor) often available
- Manufacturer incentives often favor leasing

**Example Payment Comparison:**
$40,000 vehicle, $3,000 down, 3-year term

**Lease payment:** ~$450/month
- Based on $40K vehicle depreciating to $22K (55% residual)
- Pay for $18K depreciation + interest + fees

**Finance payment:** ~$650/month  
- Based on $37K loan amount ($40K - $3K down)
- 5-year term at 6% APR

### Total Cost Analysis

**3-Year Ownership Comparison:**

**Lease costs:**
- Payments: $450 × 36 = $16,200
- Down payment: $3,000
- Fees: $1,200 (acquisition, disposition, gap insurance)
- **Total: $20,400** (no asset at end)

**Finance costs:**
- Payments: $650 × 36 = $23,400  
- Down payment: $3,000
- Vehicle value remaining: ~$28,000
- **Net cost: -$1,600** (you made money!)

**6-Year Analysis:**
- **Lease**: Two 3-year leases ≈ $42,000 total cost
- **Finance**: Continue payments, own $18,000 asset ≈ $21,000 net cost

### Break-Even Analysis

**When does financing become cheaper?**
- **Short term (1-3 years)**: Leasing usually wins
- **Medium term (4-6 years)**: Financing becomes competitive  
- **Long term (7+ years)**: Financing clearly better

**Factors affecting break-even:**
- Vehicle depreciation rate
- Interest rates vs money factors
- Mileage driven (lease penalties)
- Maintenance costs after warranty

## Mileage and Usage Considerations

### Lease Mileage Restrictions

**Standard allowances:**
- 10,000 miles/year: Lowest payments
- 12,000 miles/year: Most common
- 15,000 miles/year: Higher payments

**Overage penalties:**
- $0.15-0.30 per mile in excess
- Can add thousands to lease cost
- No refund for under-mileage

**Example overage cost:**
- 15,000 miles/year lease, drive 18,000
- 3,000 excess miles × $0.25 = $750 annually
- Over 3-year lease: $2,250 extra cost

### Wear and Tear Standards

**Normal wear and tear** (acceptable):
- Small door dings under 2 inches
- Stone chips on hood/windshield
- Tire wear with 2/32" tread remaining
- Interior wear consistent with mileage

**Excessive wear** (charged to lessee):
- Large dents, scratches, or damage
- Tire wear beyond specifications
- Stains, burns, or tears in interior
- Missing parts or accessories
- Mechanical damage or neglect

**Typical charges:**
- Tire replacement: $600-1,200 per set
- Scratch repair: $200-800 per panel
- Interior damage: $100-500 per incident
- **Total potential charges**: $2,000-5,000+
