# Break-Even Analysis Guide

## How to Use This Calculator

### Step 1: Identify Your Fixed Costs
List all expenses that remain constant regardless of sales volume:
- Rent or mortgage payments
- Insurance premiums
- Base salaries (not commission-based)
- Utilities (base amounts)
- Software subscriptions
- Equipment depreciation

**Monthly vs Annual:** Enter your costs in the same time period you want to analyze (monthly for monthly break-even, annual for yearly).

### Step 2: Determine Price Per Unit
This is how much you charge customers for each product or service:
- For products: Your selling price
- For services: Hourly rate or project fee divided by time units
- For subscriptions: Monthly or annual subscription fee

### Step 3: Calculate Variable Cost Per Unit
Costs that change with each sale:
- Raw materials
- Packaging and shipping
- Payment processing fees
- Sales commissions
- Direct labor (if hourly)

**Pro Tip:** Include all costs that wouldn't exist without that specific sale.

### Step 4: Enter Current Sales (Optional)
If you're already in business, enter your current monthly or annual unit sales to see:
- Your current profit/loss
- How much safety margin you have
- How far you are from break-even

### Step 5: Set Target Profit (Optional)
Enter desired profit to see how many units you need to sell to achieve that goal.

## Understanding Your Results

### Break-Even Point
The minimum sales volume needed to cover all costs. Below this point, you lose money. Above it, you make profit.

### Contribution Margin
Shows how much each sale contributes to covering fixed costs and profit:
- **40%+ = Excellent:** Strong pricing power
- **20-39% = Good:** Reasonable margin for most businesses
- **Under 20% = Concerning:** May need pricing or cost adjustments

### Safety Margin
Your buffer above break-even:
- **20%+ = Safe:** Good protection against market downturns
- **10-19% = Moderate:** Some protection, monitor closely
- **Under 10% = Risky:** Vulnerable to small changes in costs or demand

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting overhead costs:** Include ALL fixed costs, not just obvious ones
2. **Mixing time periods:** Don't mix monthly fixed costs with annual variable costs
3. **Ignoring one-time costs:** For new businesses, include startup costs
4. **Being too optimistic:** Use realistic, conservative sales projections
5. **Forgetting taxes:** Remember that break-even doesn't account for income taxes
