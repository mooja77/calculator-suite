# Break-Even Calculator

## What is Break-Even Analysis?

Break-even analysis helps you determine exactly how many products or services you need to sell to cover all your business costs. It's the point where your total revenue equals your total expenses - you're not losing money, but you're not making profit yet either.

## Why Use This Calculator?

**For New Businesses:**
- Determine if your business idea is viable
- Set realistic sales targets
- Plan your pricing strategy
- Understand your minimum performance requirements

**For Existing Businesses:**
- Evaluate new product lines
- Assess the impact of cost changes
- Set sales goals and budgets
- Make informed pricing decisions

## Key Terms Explained

**Fixed Costs:** Expenses that stay the same regardless of how much you sell (rent, insurance, salaries)

**Variable Costs:** Expenses that change with each unit sold (materials, shipping, commissions)

**Contribution Margin:** The amount each sale contributes to covering fixed costs (Price - Variable Cost per unit)

**Safety Margin:** How much your current sales exceed the break-even point (buffer for market fluctuations)

## Quick Example

If you're selling handmade jewelry:
- Fixed costs: $2,000/month (rent, utilities, base salary)
- Price per piece: $50
- Variable cost per piece: $20 (materials, packaging)
- Break-even: 67 pieces per month

This means you need to sell at least 67 pieces monthly to cover all costs.
