# Car Affordability Calculator - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Affordability Questions

### How much of my income should I spend on a car?
**Financial experts recommend 15-20% of gross monthly income** for total transportation costs, including:
- Car payment or depreciation
- Insurance premiums  
- Fuel costs
- Maintenance and repairs
- Registration and fees

**Example:** $60,000 annual income = $5,000 monthly × 20% = $1,000 maximum monthly transportation budget.

### What's the difference between car payment and total cost?
**Car payment** is just the financing portion. **Total cost** includes:
- Monthly loan payment: $400
- Insurance: $150/month
- Fuel: $200/month  
- Maintenance: $100/month
- **Total monthly cost: $850**

Many buyers focus only on the $400 payment but the true cost is $850/month.

### Should I buy new or used?
**New cars are better if you:**
- Plan to keep the car 7+ years
- Want latest safety/technology features
- Have stable high income
- Value warranty coverage and known history

**Used cars are better if you:**
- Want to minimize depreciation loss
- Have a limited budget
- Don't need the latest features
- Are comfortable with potential repairs

**Certified Pre-Owned** offers a middle ground with warranty protection and verified condition.

## Down Payment Questions

### How much should I put down on a car?
**Recommended down payment amounts:**
- **New cars**: 20% minimum to avoid being underwater
- **Used cars**: 10-15% minimum  
- **More is better**: Reduces monthly payment and interest costs

**Benefits of larger down payment:**
- Lower monthly payments
- Less interest paid over loan term
- Equity protection against depreciation
- Better loan approval odds

### What if I don't have a down payment?
**Zero-down options exist but have drawbacks:**
- Higher monthly payments
- More interest paid
- Immediate negative equity (owe more than car worth)
- Higher risk if car is totaled/stolen

**Better strategies:**
- Save for 3-6 months before buying
- Trade in current vehicle for down payment
- Consider less expensive vehicle
- Look for manufacturer incentives

### Can I roll my trade-in into the down payment?
**Yes, if your trade has positive equity:**
- Trade value > loan balance = down payment credit
- Trade value < loan balance = negative equity (rolled into new loan)

**Example:**
- Trade worth $15,000, owe $12,000 = $3,000 toward down payment
- Trade worth $10,000, owe $12,000 = $2,000 added to new loan

## Insurance and Operating Costs

### How much will insurance cost?
**Insurance costs vary dramatically by:**

**Age factors:**
- Under 25: $2,000-4,000+ annually
- 25-55: $1,200-2,500 annually
- Over 55: $1,000-2,200 annually

**Vehicle factors:**
- Sports cars: 2-3x higher rates
- SUVs/sedans: Moderate rates
- Economy cars: Lowest rates

**Regional factors:**
- Urban areas: 50-100% higher than rural
- High-crime areas: Theft/vandalism surcharges
- State requirements: Minimum coverage varies

**Get quotes before buying** - insurance can make an affordable car unaffordable.

### How do I estimate fuel costs?
**Calculate your annual fuel cost:**
1. Annual miles driven ÷ vehicle MPG = gallons needed
2. Gallons × local fuel price = annual fuel cost
3. Annual cost ÷ 12 = monthly fuel budget

**Example:**
- 15,000 miles ÷ 25 MPG = 600 gallons
- 600 gallons × $3.50 = $2,100 annually = $175/month

**Fuel-efficient vehicles** can save $50-150+ monthly vs gas guzzlers.

### What about maintenance costs?
**Maintenance varies by vehicle age:**

**New cars (0-3 years):**
- Mostly warranty-covered
- Oil changes, tire rotations
- $300-800 annually

**Used cars (4-7 years):**
- Brakes, tires, battery replacement
- $800-1,500 annually

**Older cars (8+ years):**
- Major component replacements
- $1,500-3,000+ annually

**Luxury brands typically cost 2-3x more** for parts and service.

## Financing Questions

### What's a good interest rate?
**Auto loan rates vary by:**

- Poor (<650): 12-20%+ APR

**New vs used:**
- New cars: Typically 1-3% lower rates
- Used cars: Higher rates, especially over 5 years old

**Loan term impact:**
- Shorter terms: Lower rates but higher payments

### How long should my car loan be?
**Recommended loan terms:**

- **Pros**: Lowest monthly payments
- **Cons**: High interest cost, long negative equity period
- **Best for**: Buyers prioritizing low payments over total cost

### Should I finance through the dealer or my bank?
**Compare both options:**

**Dealer financing pros:**

**Bank/Credit union pros:**
