# Freelance Rate Calculator

## Set Your Worth, Not Your Worries

Determining your freelance rate shouldn't be guesswork. This calculator helps you set rates that cover all your expenses, taxes, and desired income while remaining competitive in your market.

## Why Freelancers Need This Calculator

- Health insurance and benefits
- Business expenses and equipment

- Profit margin for business growth

**The Solution:**
This calculator factors in ALL the hidden costs of freelancing to ensure you charge enough to actually make your target income.

## Quick Reality Check

If you want to make $60,000 as a freelancer, you typically need to charge $40-50+ per hour, not the $30 you might think. This calculator shows you exactly why and how much.

## The Freelancer Tax Burden

Remember: As a freelancer, you pay both the employee AND employer portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes. Plus, you lose the tax advantages of employer-sponsored benefits. This calculator accounts for these often-forgotten costs.
