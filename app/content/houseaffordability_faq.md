# House Affordability Calculator - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is the 28/36 rule?
The 28/36 rule is a standard guideline used by lenders to determine home affordability:
- **28%**: Maximum percentage of gross monthly income for housing costs (PITI + fees)
- **36%**: Maximum percentage of gross monthly income for total debt payments (housing + all other debt)

This conservative approach ensures you can afford your home payments while maintaining financial stability.

### How accurate is this calculator?
Our calculator uses industry-standard formulas and regional data to provide highly accurate estimates. However, actual loan approval depends on additional factors like credit score, employment history, and lender-specific requirements. Use this as a starting point and get pre-approved with a lender for final numbers.

### Should I use the maximum amount I qualify for?
**No.** The maximum qualification amount assumes ideal conditions. Consider:
- Job security and income stability
- Future expenses (children, education, retirement)
- Desired lifestyle and discretionary spending
- Emergency fund maintenance
- Home maintenance and repair costs

Most financial experts recommend spending 20-25% of gross income on housing rather than the full 28%.

## Down Payment Questions

### How much should I put down?
**Conventional wisdom suggests 20%** to avoid mortgage insurance, but many successful homeowners put down less:

**Benefits of 20% down:**
- No mortgage insurance payments
- Lower monthly payments
- Better loan terms and rates
- Immediate equity position

**Alternatives to 20% down:**
- **5-10% down**: Higher monthly payments but get into home sooner
- **3-5% down**: FHA loans (US), first-time buyer programs
- **0% down**: VA loans, USDA loans, some regional programs

### What if I don't have 20% down?
**Don't wait if you're financially ready.** Options include:
- **PMI/CMHC/LMI**: Add insurance cost to monthly payment
- **Piggyback loans**: Second mortgage to avoid insurance
- **Gift funds**: Family assistance for down payment
- **Down payment assistance**: Government and non-profit programs

The key is ensuring your total monthly costs remain affordable.

### Can I use gift money for down payment?
**Yes, in most cases.** Requirements vary by loan type:
- **Conventional loans**: Gift funds allowed with proper documentation
- **FHA loans**: Gift funds from family members accepted
- **VA loans**: Gift funds permitted with gift letter
- **Documentation required**: Gift letter, bank statements, transfer records
