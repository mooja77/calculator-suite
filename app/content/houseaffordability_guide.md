# Complete Guide to House Affordability

## Understanding Home Affordability

### The 28/36 Debt-to-Income Rule Explained

**Housing Ratio (28% Rule)**
- Includes: Principal, interest, taxes, insurance (PITI)

### Example Calculation

**Income**: $80,000 annually ($6,667 monthly)
- Maximum housing payment: $6,667 × 28% = $1,867

- Available for housing: $2,400 - existing debt
