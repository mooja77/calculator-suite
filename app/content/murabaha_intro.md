## What is Murabaha?

Murabaha is a Sharia-compliant financing structure where the bank purchases an asset and sells it to you at cost plus an agreed profit margin. Unlike conventional mortgages, there's no interest (Riba) involved.

## Islamic Finance Models

### Diminishing Musharaka
- **Partnership**: Bank and customer jointly own the property
- **Decreasing Share**: Bank's ownership decreases with each payment
- **Risk Sharing**: Both parties share property risks

### Direct Murabaha
- **Cost-Plus Sale**: Bank buys property and sells at cost plus profit
- **Fixed Payments**: Predetermined payment amounts
- **Immediate Ownership**: Customer owns property from purchase

### Ijara Muntahia
- **Lease-to-Own**: Start as tenant, gradually become owner
- **Flexible Structure**: Combines rental with ownership building
- **Gradual Transfer**: Ownership transfers over time

Perfect for Muslims seeking halal home financing alternatives that comply with Islamic law.
