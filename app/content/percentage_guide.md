## Understanding Percentages

A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. The word "percent" comes from the Latin "per centum," meaning "by the hundred."

## Common Percentage Formulas

### Basic Percentage Formula
To find what percentage X is of Y:
```
Percentage = (X ÷ Y) × 100
```

### Finding a Percentage of a Number

```
Result = (X ÷ 100) × Y
```

### Percentage Increase
To increase a number by X%:
```
New Value = Original × (1 + X ÷ 100)
```

### Percentage Decrease
To decrease a number by X%:
```
New Value = Original × (1 - X ÷ 100)
```

## Real-World Examples

### Shopping Discounts
If a $100 item has a 20% discount:
- Discount amount: 20% of $100 = $20
- Final price: $100 - $20 = $80

### Test Scores
If you got 85 questions correct out of 100:
- Your percentage: (85 ÷ 100) × 100 = 85%

### Salary Increases
If your $50,000 salary increases by 5%:
- Increase amount: 5% of $50,000 = $2,500
- New salary: $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500
