# Rent vs Buy Calculator FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How does the rent vs buy calculator work?**
A: The calculator compares total costs of renting vs buying over a specified period, including opportunity costs, taxes, maintenance, and investment returns.

**Q: Which scenario should I choose?**
A: Choose buying if you plan to stay 5+ years, have stable income, and want to build equity. Choose renting for flexibility, lower upfront costs, or uncertain future plans.

**Q: How accurate are the results?**
A: Results are estimates based on your inputs and regional averages. Actual costs may vary based on specific properties, locations, and market conditions.

### Financial Considerations

**Q: What is opportunity cost in this context?**
A: Opportunity cost is the potential investment returns lost by using money for a down payment instead of investing it in stocks, bonds, or other assets.

**Q: Why does the calculator factor in investment returns?**
A: Money used for down payment could be invested elsewhere. The calculator compares home equity growth vs investment portfolio growth.

**Q: What if home prices fall?**
A: The calculator uses your estimated home appreciation rate. If you expect prices to fall, enter a negative appreciation rate.

### Buying Costs

**Q: What closing costs are included?**
A: Closing costs typically include:
- **US**: 2-5% of home price
- **UK**: Stamp duty, legal fees, surveys (1-4%)
- **Canada**: Land transfer tax, legal fees (1-3%)
- **Australia**: Stamp duty, legal fees (2-5%)

**Q: What ongoing costs are considered for buying?**
A: Property taxes, HOA fees, maintenance (typically 1% of home value annually), insurance, and mortgage interest.

**Q: Is PMI/mortgage insurance included?**
A: Yes, for down payments under 20% in US, CMHC insurance in Canada, and LMI in Australia.

### Renting Costs

**Q: How is rent increase calculated?**
A: The calculator uses your specified annual rent increase rate, typically 2-4% depending on location and market conditions.

**Q: Are there any additional renting costs?**
A: The calculator focuses on rent payments. You may have additional costs like renter's insurance, utilities, or moving expenses.

### Regional Differences

**Q: How do tax benefits differ by country?**
A: Tax benefits vary:
- **US**: Mortgage interest and property tax deductions
- **UK**: No capital gains tax on primary residence
- **Canada**: No capital gains tax on principal residence
- **Australia**: No capital gains tax on primary residence

**Q: Are property tax rates accurate?**
A: We use regional averages. Actual rates vary by specific location, property value, and local government policies.

### Timeframe and Planning

**Q: What's the typical break-even point?**
A: Generally 3-7 years, depending on local market conditions, down payment size, and rent vs mortgage payment ratios.

**Q: Should I buy if I might move in 2-3 years?**
A: Usually no. Transaction costs and lack of equity building make short-term buying financially disadvantageous.

**Q: How do I factor in job relocation?**
A: If relocation is likely, factor in selling costs (6-10% of home value) or potential rental income if keeping the property.

### Market Considerations

**Q: How do interest rates affect the calculation?**
A: Higher mortgage rates increase buying costs and monthly payments, making renting more attractive financially.

**Q: What if the rental market is tight?**
A: In competitive rental markets, you might face frequent moves, rent increases above market average, or difficulty finding suitable properties.

**Q: Should I consider rent control laws?**
A: Yes, rent-controlled areas may have lower rent increases, making renting more financially attractive long-term.

### Advanced Scenarios

**Q: What about buying rental property while renting primary residence?**
A: This calculator focuses on primary residence. Investment property analysis requires different considerations like rental income, vacancy rates, and depreciation.

**Q: How do I factor in home improvements?**
A: Include major improvements in maintenance costs. Some improvements add to home value, but typically at less than 100% cost recovery.

**Q: What if I inherit a property?**
A: Inherited property changes the equation significantly. Consider only ongoing costs vs renting since there's no purchase price or down payment.
