# 401k Calculator FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 401k Basics

**Q: What is a 401k plan?**
A: A 401k is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that allows employees to contribute pre-tax income, reducing current taxable income while saving for retirement.

**Q: How much can I contribute to my 401k in 2024?**
A: The contribution limit is $23,000 for 2024. If you're 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution (total $30,500).

**Q: What is employer matching?**
A: Many employers match a percentage of your contributions, typically 25-100% of your contribution up to 3-6% of your salary. This is free money you should maximize.

### Contribution Strategies

**Q: How much should I contribute to my 401k?**
A: Financial experts recommend:
1. **Minimum**: Contribute enough to get full employer match
2. **Good**: 10-15% of your salary including employer match
3. **Excellent**: Maximum allowed by IRS ($23,000 in 2024)

**Q: Should I contribute to 401k or pay off debt first?**
A: Generally:
1. Contribute enough to get employer match (free money)
2. Pay off high-interest debt (>7-8%)
3. Increase 401k contributions
4. Pay off moderate-interest debt

**Q: What if I can't afford the maximum contribution?**
A: Start with employer match, then increase by 1% annually or with salary raises. Even small amounts compound significantly over time.

### Investment Growth

**Q: What return rate should I expect?**
A: Historical stock market returns average 10% annually, but many financial planners use 6-8% for conservative estimates accounting for inflation and fees.

**Q: How does compound interest work in 401k?**
A: Your contributions earn returns, and those returns earn returns. Over decades, compound growth becomes the largest portion of your balance.

**Q: Should I invest in stocks or bonds in my 401k?**
A: Generally, younger investors should favor stocks for growth, gradually shifting to bonds as they near retirement. Consider target-date funds for automatic rebalancing.

### Employer Matching

**Q: How does employer matching work?**
A: Common formulas:
- **50% match up to 6%**: Employer contributes $0.50 for every $1 you contribute, up to 6% of salary
- **100% match up to 3%**: Dollar-for-dollar match up to 3% of salary

**Q: When am I vested in employer contributions?**
A: Vesting schedules vary:
- **Immediate**: 100% vested immediately
- **Cliff**: 100% vested after 3 years
- **Graded**: 20% per year over 5 years

**Q: What happens to unvested funds if I leave?**
A: You forfeit unvested employer contributions, but your own contributions are always 100% yours.

### Retirement Planning

**Q: How much do I need for retirement?**
A: Common rules of thumb:
- **10x salary** by retirement age
- **70-90%** of pre-retirement income annually
- **$1 million+** for comfortable retirement

**Q: What is the 4% withdrawal rule?**
A: The traditional rule suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement savings annually. Our calculator offers conservative (3.5%), moderate (4%), and aggressive (4.5%) options.

**Q: When can I withdraw from my 401k?**
A: Generally age 59Â½ without penalties. Required minimum distributions start at age 73. Early withdrawals face 10% penalty plus income taxes.

### Tax Considerations

**Q: Are 401k contributions tax-deductible?**
A: Traditional 401k contributions are pre-tax, reducing your current taxable income. You pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.

**Q: What about Roth 401k?**
A: Roth 401k uses after-tax contributions but withdrawals are tax-free in retirement. Good for younger workers expecting higher future tax rates.

**Q: How do taxes work in retirement?**
A: 401k withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Many retirees are in lower tax brackets, but consider state taxes and Medicare premiums.

### Common Scenarios

**Q: What if I change jobs?**
A: You can:
1. Leave money in old employer's plan
2. Roll over to new employer's 401k
3. Roll over to IRA for more investment options
4. Cash out (not recommended due to taxes/penalties)

**Q: Can I borrow from my 401k?**
A: Many plans allow loans up to 50% of balance or $50,000, whichever is less. You pay interest to yourself, but miss out on investment growth.

**Q: What about 401k fees?**
A: Plans charge administrative fees (0.5-2% annually). High fees significantly impact long-term growth, so understand your plan's costs.

### Advanced Planning

**Q: Should I contribute more as I get older?**
A: Yes, catch-up contributions at 50+ allow extra savings when earnings typically peak and expenses may decrease.

**Q: How does inflation affect my retirement savings?**
A: Inflation reduces purchasing power over time. The calculator shows inflation-adjusted values to understand real retirement income.

**Q: What if Social Security isn't available?**
A: While unlikely to completely disappear, benefits may be reduced. Don't rely solely on Social Security - maximize your 401k contributions.
