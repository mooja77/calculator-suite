# Student Loan Calculator FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How accurate is the student loan calculator?**
A: The calculator uses current federal loan terms and repayment formulas. Results are estimates - contact your loan servicer for exact amounts.

**Q: Does this work for private student loans?**
A: Yes, for basic calculations. However, income-driven plans are typically only available for federal loans.

**Q: Can I use this for parent PLUS loans?**
A: Yes, for standard repayment calculations. Parent PLUS loans have different terms and fewer repayment options.

### Federal Repayment Plans

**Q: What's the difference between IBR, PAYE, and REPAYE?**
A: All cap payments at 10-15% of discretionary income but have different eligibility requirements:
- **IBR**: 10-15% depending on when you borrowed
- **PAYE**: 10%, must show financial hardship
- **REPAYE**: 10%, no financial hardship requirement

**Q: How is discretionary income calculated?**
A: Discretionary income = Adjusted Gross Income - 150% of poverty guideline for your family size and state.

**Q: What happens to unpaid interest on income-driven plans?**
A: Depends on the plan:
- **REPAYE**: Government pays 50% of unpaid interest
- **Other plans**: Unpaid interest capitalizes (added to principal)

### Loan Forgiveness

**Q: When is my loan forgiven on income-driven plans?**
A: After 20-25 years of qualifying payments:
- **IBR/PAYE**: 20 years
- **REPAYE**: 20 years (undergraduate), 25 years (graduate)
- **ICR**: 25 years

**Q: Is forgiven debt taxable?**
A: Currently yes, but the American Rescue Plan Act exempts forgiven debt from taxes through 2025.

A: PSLF forgives federal loans after 120 qualifying payments while working for qualifying employers. This calculator doesn't include PSLF.

### Extra Payments

**Q: Should I make extra payments on student loans?**
A: Consider your situation:
- **Yes**: If loan rate > expected investment returns
- **No**: If you have higher-interest debt or lack emergency fund

**Q: How should I apply extra payments?**
A: Apply to principal balance of highest interest rate loans first for maximum savings.

**Q: Can I make extra payments on income-driven plans?**
A: Yes, extra payments reduce principal and can help avoid interest capitalization.

### Interest and Capitalization

**Q: When does interest capitalize?**
A: Interest typically capitalizes when:
- You leave school
- Your grace period ends
- You exit deferment/forbearance
- You no longer qualify for income-driven plans

**Q: How can I minimize capitalized interest?**
A: Make interest payments during school, grace periods, or deferment when possible.

### Repayment Strategy

**Q: Which repayment plan saves the most money?**
A: Standard 10-year plan typically has lowest total interest. Income-driven plans may cost more but offer lower monthly payments and forgiveness.

**Q: Should I consolidate my loans?**
A: Consolidation can simplify payments and provide access to income-driven plans, but may increase total interest paid.

**Q: When should I refinance student loans?**
A: Consider refinancing private loans if you qualify for lower rates, but be cautious with federal loans as you'll lose federal protections.

### Income-Driven Plan Details

**Q: What if my income changes?**
A: You must recertify income annually. Payment amounts adjust based on your new income and family size.

**Q: What if I'm unemployed?**
A: With $0 qualifying income, your payment may be $0, but interest continues to accrue (except subsidized portions on REPAYE).

**Q: Can married couples file taxes separately?**
A: Yes, and it may lower payments on IBR and PAYE (but not REPAYE) by excluding spouse's income.

### Special Situations

**Q: What about loans in default?**
A: Defaulted loans must be rehabilitated or consolidated before accessing most repayment plans.

**Q: Do I qualify for interest rate discounts?**
A: Some servicers offer 0.25% rate reductions for automatic payments. Check with your servicer.

**Q: How do tax refunds affect calculations?**
A: Tax refunds can be applied as extra payments to significantly reduce loan balances and total interest.
