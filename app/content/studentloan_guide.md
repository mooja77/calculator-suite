## Understanding Repayment Plans

### Standard Repayment Plans

**Standard (10-Year)**:
- **Payment**: Fixed monthly amount
- **Pros**: Lowest total interest, fastest payoff
- **Cons**: Highest monthly payment
- **Best for**: Stable income, want to minimize total cost

**Graduated Repayment**:
- **Payment**: Starts low, increases every 2 years
- **Pros**: Lower initial payments
- **Cons**: Higher total interest than standard
- **Best for**: Expecting income growth, need lower initial payments

**Extended Repayment**:
- **Payment**: Fixed or graduated over 25 years
- **Pros**: Lower monthly payments
- **Cons**: Much higher total interest
- **Best for**: Need very low payments, not eligible for income-driven

### Income-Driven Repayment Plans

**Income-Based Repayment (IBR)**:
- **Payment**: 10-15% of discretionary income
- **Forgiveness**: After 20-25 years
- **Pros**: Caps payment, potential forgiveness
- **Best for**: High debt-to-income ratio, financial hardship

**Pay As You Earn (PAYE)**:
- **Payment**: 10% of discretionary income
- **Forgiveness**: After 20 years
- **Eligibility**: Must show financial hardship
- **Best for**: New borrowers with high debt

**Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE)**:
- **Payment**: 10% of discretionary income
- **Forgiveness**: 20-25 years (undergraduate/graduate)
- **Pros**: Interest subsidy, no hardship requirement
- **Best for**: Most federal loan borrowers

**Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)**:
- **Payment**: 20% of discretionary income or 12-year standard
- **Forgiveness**: After 25 years
- **Best for**: Parent PLUS borrowers (after consolidation)

## Choosing the Right Plan

### Decision Framework

**Prioritize Lowest Total Cost**:
→ Choose Standard 10-Year Plan
- Highest monthly payment but lowest total interest
- Best if you can afford the payments

**Need Lower Monthly Payments**:
→ Consider Income-Driven Plans
- Payment based on income, not loan balance
- Potential for forgiveness after 20-25 years

**Expecting Income Growth**:
→ Consider Graduated Plan
- Lower payments initially, increase over time
- Good for residents, recent graduates in growing careers

**Financial Hardship**:
→ Choose Income-Driven Plans
- Payments as low as $0 with very low income
- Protection against unaffordable payments

### Income-Driven Plan Selection

**Choose REPAYE if**:
- You want the interest subsidy benefit
- You're not married or file taxes jointly
- You have both undergraduate and graduate loans

**Choose PAYE if**:
- You're married and file separately (excludes spouse income)
- You have high income but demonstrate hardship
- You want 20-year forgiveness

**Choose IBR if**:
- You're married and file separately (old IBR version)
- You don't qualify for PAYE
- You want borrower protections

**Choose ICR if**:
- You have Parent PLUS loans (after consolidation)
- You don't qualify for other income-driven plans

## Extra Payment Strategies

### Where to Apply Extra Payments
1. **Highest Interest Rate First**: Maximum interest savings
2. **Smallest Balance First**: Psychological motivation ("snowball")
3. **Private Loans First**: No forgiveness, often higher rates
4. **Unsubsidized Loans First**: No government interest subsidies

### When to Make Extra Payments

**Make Extra Payments if**:
- Loan interest rate > expected investment returns
- You want guaranteed return (interest savings)
- You have stable emergency fund
- You're not pursuing loan forgiveness

**Skip Extra Payments if**:
- Pursuing loan forgiveness (income-driven plans)
- Have higher-interest debt (credit cards)
- Need emergency fund
- Better investment opportunities available

### Timing Strategies
- **During Grace Period**: Prevents interest capitalization
- **Before Interest Capitalizes**: When leaving school, changing plans
- **Annual Windfall**: Tax refunds, bonuses
- **Biweekly Payments**: Equivalent to 13 monthly payments per year

## Loan Forgiveness Programs

### Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)
- **Eligibility**: 120 payments while working for qualifying employer
- **Qualifying Employment**: Government, 501(c)(3) nonprofits
- **Required Plan**: Must be on income-driven or standard 10-year plan
- **Tax Treatment**: Forgiven amount not taxable

### Income-Driven Plan Forgiveness
- **Timeline**: 20-25 years of payments
- **Tax Treatment**: Forgiven amount currently taxable (may change)
- **Payment Counting**: Only payments on income-driven plans count
- **Recertification**: Must recertify income annually

### State-Specific Programs
- **Teacher Loan Forgiveness**: Up to $17,500 for qualifying teachers
- **Health Professional Programs**: Various state and federal programs
- **Military Service**: Benefits vary by branch and program
- **Volunteer Service**: AmeriCorps, Peace Corps, etc.

## Advanced Strategies

### Loan Consolidation
**Benefits**:
- Simplifies payments (one loan, one servicer)
- Access to income-driven plans for some loans
- Reset forbearance/deferment limits

**Drawbacks**:
- Weighted average interest rate (rounded up)
- Restart forgiveness timeline
- Lose borrower benefits on original loans

### Refinancing (Private)
**Consider if**:
- Good credit score (typically 650+)
- Stable income
- Want lower interest rate
- Not pursuing forgiveness

**Avoid if**:
- Pursuing loan forgiveness
- Need income-driven payment flexibility
- Federal loan protections important

### Tax Strategies
- **Student Loan Interest Deduction**: Up to $2,500 annually
- **American Opportunity Credit**: For eligible education expenses
- **Filing Status**: Married filing separately may reduce income-driven payments
- **Tax Planning**: Consider forgiveness tax implications

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not exploring all repayment options**
2. **Ignoring income-driven plan recertification**
3. **Making extra payments while pursuing forgiveness**
4. **Refinancing federal loans without understanding consequences**
5. **Not keeping detailed payment records**
6. **Assuming forbearance is always the best option**
7. **Not researching employer loan assistance programs**

## Emergency Situations

### If You Can't Make Payments
1. **Contact servicer immediately**
2. **Explore income-driven plans**
3. **Consider deferment or forbearance**
4. **Avoid default at all costs**

### Deferment vs Forbearance
**Deferment**:
- Specific qualifying circumstances
- Interest may not accrue on subsidized loans
- Doesn't count toward forgiveness

**Forbearance**:
- General financial hardship
- Interest accrues on all loans
- Use sparingly as last resort
