# Zakat Calculator - Frequently Asked Questions

## Basic Zakat Questions

**Q: What is Zakat and why is it important?**
A: Zakat is the third pillar of Islam, an obligatory charity of 2.5% on eligible wealth. It purifies wealth, helps the needy, and is a fundamental act of worship that brings spiritual and social benefits.

**Q: Who must pay Zakat?**
A: Adult Muslims who possess wealth above the Nisab threshold for a full lunar year must pay Zakat. Mental capacity and freedom from debt are also considerations.

**Q: How much Zakat do I need to pay?**
A: The standard rate is 2.5% (1/40th) of your eligible wealth that exceeds the Nisab threshold.

## Nisab and Thresholds

**Q: What is Nisab?**
A: Nisab is the minimum threshold of wealth that makes Zakat obligatory. It's equivalent to 87.48 grams of gold or 612.36 grams of silver.

**Q: Should I use gold or silver Nisab?**
A: Most scholars recommend using whichever threshold is lower, as this is more beneficial to the poor. Currently, silver Nisab is typically lower.

**Q: How often is Nisab updated?**
A: Nisab should be calculated using current precious metal prices, which fluctuate daily. Check current rates when calculating your Zakat.

## Calculating Zakat

**Q: What assets are subject to Zakat?**
A: Cash, bank deposits, gold/silver (above personal use), business inventory, investments, and recoverable debts are typically subject to Zakat.

**Q: Can I deduct my debts from my wealth?**
A: Yes, legitimate debts (loans, credit cards, money owed to others) should be deducted from your total wealth before calculating Zakat.

**Q: Is my house subject to Zakat?**
A: No, your primary residence is not subject to Zakat as it's considered a basic need. However, investment properties may be subject to Zakat.

## Timing and Lunar Year

**Q: What is the lunar year requirement?**
A: You must possess wealth above Nisab for a complete lunar year (354 days) before Zakat becomes due on that wealth.

**Q: What if my wealth fluctuates during the year?**
A: If your wealth falls below Nisab during the year, the lunar year count restarts. Some scholars accept average wealth calculations.

**Q: Can I use the Gregorian calendar instead of lunar?**
A: While the lunar calendar is traditional, some scholars accept Gregorian year calculations for practical purposes. Consult your local Islamic authority.

## Special Situations

**Q: Do I pay Zakat on my pension fund or 401(k)?**
A: This depends on your access to the funds. If you can withdraw the money, it may be subject to Zakat. If it's completely inaccessible, it typically isn't.

**Q: What about cryptocurrency?**
A: Most contemporary scholars treat cryptocurrency like other investments, making it subject to Zakat if held for a lunar year and above Nisab.

**Q: Is jewelry subject to Zakat?**
A: There's scholarly difference on this. Some exempt jewelry for personal use, others include all gold/silver. Consult your preferred Islamic authority.

## Business and Investments

**Q: What about stocks and mutual funds?**
A: These are typically subject to Zakat at their market value on your Zakat anniversary date.

**Q: Can I give Zakat to my family?**

A: Zakat is a religious obligation regardless of tax implications. Pay your Zakat as required by Islamic law and handle taxes according to local regulations.

**Q: Should I pay Zakat monthly or annually?**
A: While the obligation is annual, you can pay monthly if it helps with cash flow, as long as you meet your annual obligation.
