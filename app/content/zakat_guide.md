# Zakat Calculator Guide

## Understanding Zakat

Zakat (زکاة‎) is the third pillar of Islam and represents a fundamental act of worship through charity. It is an obligatory form of almsgiving that purifies wealth and helps redistribute resources to those in need.

## Basic Principles of Zakat

### 1. Nisab Threshold
The minimum amount of wealth required before Zakat becomes obligatory:
- **Gold Standard**: 87.48 grams of gold (20 mithqal)
- **Silver Standard**: 612.36 grams of silver (200 dirhams)
- **Current Practice**: Use the lower threshold (more beneficial to the poor)

### 2. Hawl (One Lunar Year)
- Wealth must be possessed for a complete lunar year (354 days)
- If wealth falls below Nisab during the year, the count restarts
- Calculate on the same date each year for consistency

### 3. Zakat Rate
- **Standard Rate**: 2.5% (1/40th) of eligible wealth
- Applied to net wealth after deducting legitimate debts
- Calculated annually on the Zakat due date

## Assets Subject to Zakat

### Monetary Assets
- **Cash**: Currency, bank deposits, savings accounts
- **Investments**: Stocks, bonds, mutual funds (at market value)
- **Business Inventory**: Stock held for trade
- **Accounts Receivable**: Money owed to you (if recoverable)

### Precious Metals
- **Gold**: Jewelry, coins, bars (above personal use needs)
- **Silver**: Jewelry, coins, bars (above personal use needs)
- **Note**: Personal jewelry for daily use may be exempt (scholarly differences exist)

### Business Assets
- **Trading Stock**: Inventory intended for sale
- **Business Cash**: Working capital and profits
- **Partnership Shares**: Based on your ownership percentage

## Assets NOT Subject to Zakat

- **Personal Residence**: Primary home and household items
- **Personal Vehicles**: Cars used for personal transportation
- **Tools of Trade**: Equipment needed for your profession
- **Personal Clothing**: Everyday clothing and necessities
- **Debts**: Money you owe to others (deducted from wealth)

## How to Calculate Zakat

### Step 1: Determine Your Zakatable Assets
Add up all assets subject to Zakat:
- Cash and bank balances
- Value of gold and silver (above personal use)
- Investment values
- Business inventory
- Money owed to you

### Step 2: Subtract Debts
Deduct legitimate debts:
- Outstanding loans
- Credit card debt
- Money you owe to others
- Immediate bills and obligations

### Step 3: Check Nisab Threshold
- Compare net wealth to current Nisab
- If below Nisab, no Zakat is due
- If above Nisab, proceed to calculation

### Step 4: Apply Hawl Requirement
- Ensure wealth was above Nisab for full lunar year
- If wealth fluctuated, use the amount held consistently

### Step 5: Calculate Zakat
- Net Zakatable Wealth × 2.5% = Zakat Due
- Example: $10,000 × 0.025 = $250 Zakat

## Special Considerations

### Lunar vs. Gregorian Calendar
- Islamic calendar has 354 days vs. 365 days
- Adjust calculations if using Gregorian dates
- Some scholars accept Gregorian year calculations

### Currency Fluctuations
- Calculate in your local currency
- Use current exchange rates for conversions
- Consider currency stability when planning

### Regional Variations
- Consult local Islamic scholars for specific guidance
- Some regions have established Nisab amounts
- Tax deductibility varies by country

## Recipients of Zakat (Asnaf)

Zakat must be given to eligible recipients as defined in the Quran:

1. **Al-Fuqara** (The Poor): Those without means of livelihood
2. **Al-Masakin** (The Needy): Those with insufficient means
3. **Zakat Administrators**: Those appointed to collect and distribute
4. **Al-Mu'allafah Qulubuhum** (New Muslims): Those whose hearts are to be reconciled
5. **Ar-Riqab** (Slaves to be freed): Those in bondage (historically)
6. **Al-Gharimin** (Debtors): Those in debt (for legitimate reasons)
7. **Fi Sabilillah** (In the path of Allah): For Islamic causes and jihad
8. **Ibn as-Sabil** (Travelers): Stranded travelers in need

## Best Practices
